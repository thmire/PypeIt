    The dimensionality of the boxcar matches the dimensionality of the provided

    the return description.  In contrast with a boxcar smoothing algorithm, the
    step between each boxcar average is the size of the box, not one pixel.

    Identify cosmic rays using the L.A.Cosmic algorithm.

    See Peter van Dokkum's `L.A.Cosmic`_ website and `van Dokkum (2001, PASP,

    This routine is mostly courtesy of Malte Tewes with some updates/alterations
    by the ``PypeIt`` developers.

        sciframe (`numpy.ndarray`_):
            Science frame to process.
        saturation (:obj:`float`, `numpy.ndarray`_, optional):
            The saturation level of the detector in units that match the
            provided frame.  This is used to flag pixels to ignore.  Can be a
            single value or an array; if the latter, the shape must match
            ``sciframe``.  If None, no pixels are flagged as being saturated.
        nonlinear (:obj:`float`, `numpy.ndarray`_, optional):
            The fraction of the saturation level at which the detector response
            becomes non-linear.  Can be a single value or an array; if the
            latter, the shape must match ``sciframe``.
        bpm (`numpy.ndarray`_, optional):
            Bad-pixel mask for the input science frame.  If None, all pixels are
            considered available to be flagged as cosmic rays.  Shape must match
            ``sciframe``.
        varframe (`numpy.ndarray`_, optional):
            The variance in the science frame to process.  If None, the variance
            is estimated by the absolute value of a :math:`5\times 5` boxcar
            median filter of the image.
        maxiter (:obj:`int`, optional):
            Maximum number of detection iterations.
        grow (:obj:`float`, optional):
            The radius (in pixels) used to grow the region masked around
            detected cosmic rays.  See :func:`grow_mask`.  If :math:`\leq 0`,
            the cosmic-ray mask regions are not grown.
        remove_compact_obj (:obj:`bool`, optional):
            Remove likely compact objects from the set of detected cosmic rays.
            This is performed by default here and in the original L.A.Cosmic
            algorithm.
        sigclip (:obj:`float`, optional):
            Threshold for identifying a cosmic ray
        sigfrac (:obj:`float`, optional):
            Fraction of ``sigclip`` used to define the lower threshold used for
            pixels neighboring identified cosmic-rays.

            traditional component of the L.A.Cosmic algorithm.

    Returns:

        rays; True means the pixel has a cosmic ray.

    noise is a fixed :math:`\sqrt{1/12}` ADU [1]_ [2]_, derived as the second
    moment of a uniform distribution between values of -1/2 to 1/2 (i.e., the

        - :math:`C` is the observed number of sky + object counts,
        - :math:`s=s\prime / N_{\rm frames}` is a scale factor derived

          ``exptime``),

          read-noise squared; see ``rn_var``),

          bias subtraction; see ``proc_var``), and

          signal-to-noise on the observed counts.

        - If :math:`s` (``count_scale``) is provided, the variance will be 0
          wherever :math:`s \leq 0`.

        - Note that dark current is typically given in electrons per second *per
          pixel*.  If on-chip binning was used for the detector readout, each
          binned pixel will have accummulated the expected dark-current (in
          e-/s/pixel) multiplied by the number of binned pixels.  Beware the
          units of ``darkcurr``, both in that it is dark-current per *hour* and
          that it is the dark-current expected in the *binned* pixel.  For
          example, see the calling function
          :func:`pypeit.images.rawimage.RawImage.build_ivar`.
        
        - The input arrays can have any dimensionality (i.e., they can be single
          2D images or a 3D array containing multiple 2D images); however, the

            from the instrument detector; see :func:`rn2_frame`.  This should
            include digitization noise and any difference in the readnoise
            across the detector due to the use of multiple amplifiers.
            Readnoise should be in e-, meaning this is in elections squared.
        darkcurr (:obj:`float`, `numpy.ndarray`_, optional):
            Dark current in electrons per **hour** (as is the convention for the
            :class:`~pypeit.images.detector_container.DetectorContainer` object)
            if the exposure time is provided, otherwise in electrons.  Note that
            this is the dark-current in each read pixel, meaning you likely need
            to multiply the quoted detector dark-current by the number of pixels
            in a bin (e.g., 4 for 2x2 binning) for binned data.  If None, set to
            0.  If a single float, assumed to be constant across the full image.
            If an array, the shape must match ``rn_var``.
        exptime (:obj:`float`, optional):
            Exposure time in seconds.  If None, dark current *must* be
            in electrons.
        proc_var (:obj:`float`, `numpy.ndarray`_, optional):
            Additional variance terms to include that are due to the image
            processing steps (e.g., bias subtraction).  If None, set to 0.  If a
            single float, assumed to be constant across the full image.  If an

        count_scale (:obj:`float`, `numpy.ndarray`_, optional):
            A scale factor that *has already been applied* to the provided
            counts. It accounts for the number of frames contributing to
            the provided counts, and the relative throughput factors that
            can be measured from flat-field frames. For example, if the image
            has been flat-field corrected, this is the inverse of the flat-field counts.
            If None, set to 1. If a single float, assumed to be constant across the full image.

    which is the quantity returned by this function.

    We emphasize that this is a *model* for the per-pixel image variance.  In
    real data, the as-observed pixel values are used to estimate the Poisson
    error in the observed counts.  Because of the variance in the image, this
    systematically overestimates the variance toward low counts (:math:`\lesssim
    2 \sigma_{\rm rn}`), with a bias of approximately :math:`1.4/\sigma_{\rm

    10% for :math:`C=1`.

    .. warning::

        - If :math:`s` (``count_scale``) is provided, the variance will be 0
          wherever :math:`s \leq 0`, modulo the provided ``noise_floor``.

        - The input arrays can have any dimensionality (i.e., they can be single
          2D images or a 3D array containing multiple 2D images); however,
          currently the noise floor must be a single scalar applied to all array
          values.

    Args:
        base (`numpy.ndarray`_):
            The "base-level" variance in the data set by the detector properties
            and the image processing steps.  See :func:`base_variance`;
            :math:`V_{\rm base}` in the equations above.
        counts (`numpy.ndarray`_, optional):
            An array with the number of source-plus-sky counts, possibly
            rescaled by a relative throughput; see :math:`c` in the equations
            above.  Because this is used to calculate the noise floor, this
            *must* be provided if ``noise_floor`` is not None.  Shape must match
            ``base``.  Shape must match ``base``.
        count_scale (:obj:`float`, `numpy.ndarray`_, optional):
            A scale factor that *has already been applied* to the provided
            counts; see :math:`s` in the equations above.  It accounts for
            the number of frames contributing to  the provided counts, and
            the relative throughput factors that  can be measured from flat-field frames.
            For example, if the image has been flat-field corrected, this is the inverse
            of the flat-field counts.  If None, no scaling is expected, meaning
            ``counts`` are exactly the observed detector counts.  If a single
            float, assumed to be constant across the full image.  If an array,
            the shape must match ``base``.  The variance will be 0 wherever
            :math:`s \leq 0`, modulo the provided ``noise_floor``.
        noise_floor (:obj:`float`, optional):
            A fraction of the counts to add to the variance, which has the
            effect of ensuring that the S/N is never greater than
            ``1/noise_floor``; see :math:`epsilon` in the equations above.  If
            None, no noise floor is added.  If not None, ``counts`` *must* be
            provided.

    Returns:
        `numpy.ndarray`_: Variance image computed via the equation above with
        the same shape as ``base``.
