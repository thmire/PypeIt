#This directory contains data files for X-shooter reference
#spectra of six selected southern standard stars. The
#selection of the stars, measurement of their fluxes and
#comparison to atmospheric models is presented in Moehler
#et al. 2014, A&A, 568, 9; see also Moehler et al., 2014,
#The Messenger, 158, 16.
#Model atmosphere spectra of six spectrophotometric standard stars observable from
#the southern hemisphere were selected as reference spectra using X-shooter observations.
#They are hot white dwarfs (WD) or subdwarfs (sdO) with independent flux information.
#The flux distribution over the full X-shooter range 3000 â€“ 25000A is tabulated.
#The fluxes are sampled (at 0.1A [< 1000A] and 0.2A [>10000A]).
#The flux tabluations are in units of (ergs cm-2 s-1 A-1).
#NOTE: The wavelengths are in air, as output by the ESO pipeline.
