Overview
========

This file summarizes several instrument specific
items for the SOAR/Goodman spectrograph. 

Note that there are two ways to download your data from the
archive:

(1) in .fits format -- these have been pre-processed and are not PypeIt compliant
(2) in .fits.fz format -- these are the raw frames from the telescope

PypeIt will only work with the .fz format, so please
ensure that you are only using data in this format.

We recommend downloading the data from here:
