Overview

This file summarizes several instrument specific settings that are related to the Keck/HIRES spectrograph.


Wavelengths
===========

See :ref:`wvcalib-echelle` for details on the wavelength calibration.

We also note that several Orders from 40-45 are 
frequently flagged as bad in the wavelength solution.  
This is due, in part, to very bright ThAr line contamination.
