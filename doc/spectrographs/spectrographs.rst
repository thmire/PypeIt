Spectrographs

Overview
========

Below we describe all of the spectrographs with existing code infrastructure
that enables PypeIt to reduce the data. Most of these spectrographs are
"supported," meaning that the reduction of the relevant data has been
well-vetted by PypeIt developers. "Unsupported" spectrographs are
in-development; however, the development timescale is undefined.

For instructions on how to add a new spectrograph see:
:doc:`../dev/new_spectrograph`.  Additional details for each spectrograph are
provided via the links :ref:`below<spec_details>`.
