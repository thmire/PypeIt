Starting after version 1.14.0, the logged changes are now only recorded by these
release docs.  Before that, a detailed log of code edits (including releases
earlier than version 1.5.0) was kept in a single location; see the `CHANGELOG
<https://github.com/pypeit/PypeIt/blob/release/CHANGES.rst>`__.
