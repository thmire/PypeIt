.. index:: Frame_Type

Overview
========

Every raw data file ingested by PypeIt must be given a frame
type. This identifies how the frame should be treated and included in
the data reduction.

Frame typing can be done automatically by running :ref:`pypeit_setup`, which is
a simple wrapper for :class:`~pypeit.pypeitsetup.PypeItSetup`. The type of frame
for each data file is automatically identified as one or more of the types
listed in the table below; any files that could not be identified are given a
frame type set to ``None``.

The robustness of the automated typing of :ref:`calibration
frames<calibrations>` varies with some :ref:`instruments` being much more robust
than others.  Automated typing of ``science`` versus ``standard`` frames is
generally not robust for any instrument.  *Always inspect your*
:ref:`pypeit_file` *to ensure the frame typing is correct!*

Definitions
===========

The possible frame types defined by PypeIt and a brief
description can be listed as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    from pypeit.core.framematch import FrameTypeBitMask
    FrameTypeBitMask().info()

More detailed descriptions are given in the table below.

==================== =============================================================
Frame Type           Description
==================== =============================================================
``align``            Used to align spatial positions in multiple slits. This frame is particularly useful for slit-based IFU, such as Keck KCWI.
``arc``              Spectrum of one or more calibration arc lamps
``bias``             Bias frame;  typically a 0s exposure with the shutter closed
``dark``             Dark frame;  typically a >0s exposure to assess dark current (shutter closed)
``illumflat``        Spectrum taken to correct illumination profile of the slit(s). This is often the same as the trace flat (below).
``lampoffflats``     Spectrum taken to remove persistence from lamp on flat exposures and/or thermal emission from the telescope and dome. Usually this is an exposure using a flat with lamps OFF
``pinhole``          Spectrum taken through a pinhole slit (i.e. a very short slit length), and is used to define the centre if a slit (currently, this frame is only used for echelle data reduction). Often this is an exposure using a flat lamp, but one can in principle use a standard star frame too (or a science frame if the spectrum is uniform).
``pixelflat``        Spectrum taken to correct for pixel-to-pixel detector variations. Often an exposure using a dome (recommended) or internal flat lamp, but for observations in the very blue, this may be on-sky
``slitless_pixflat`` Spectrum taken without a slitmask or longslit to correct for pixel-to-pixel detector variations. This is often an exposure taken on-sky
``science``          Spectrum of one or more science targets
``standard``         Spectrum of spectrophotometric standard star PypeIt includes a list of pre-defined standards
``trace``            Spectrum taken to define the slit edges. Often this is an exposure using a flat lamp, but for observations in the very blue, this may be on-sky. The slit length of a trace frame should be the same as the science slit.
``tilt``             Exposure used to trace the tilt in the wavelength solution. Often the same file(s) as the arc.
``sky``              On-sky observation of the sky used for background subtraction
``None``             File could not be automatically identified by PypeIt
==================== =============================================================

.. TODO: Need to check that "sky" frametype is correct and/or used!

It is possible (and even common for arc and flats images) that a frame can be
assigned more than one frame type.

.. warning:: 

    Any execution of :ref:`run-pypeit` will *crash* if your :doc:`pypeit_file`
    includes entries with ``None`` frame types defined.  You must either remove
    or edit those entries in the pypeit file by-hand after running
    :ref:`pypeit_setup`.

Automated Typing
================

Automated typing of files is performed by :ref:`pypeit_setup`.

In detail, :class:`~pypeit.pypeitsetup.PypeItSetup` builds a table of
metadata for all files found using the search key provided to its
:func:`~pypeit.pypeitsetup.PypeItSetup.from_file_root` method. The
metadata itself is gathered and maintained by
:class:`~pypeit.metadata.PypeItMetaData` based on a set of header
keywords that are defined for each supported spectrograph. For
example, the metadata keywords for Keck DEIMOS reductions are:

.. include:: include/deimos_meta_key_map.rst

which can be obtained by executing

.. code-block:: bash

    pypeit_obslog keck_deimos -k

See :ref:`pypeit_obslog`.

The method :func:`~pypeit.metadata.PypeItMetaData.get_frame_types`
uses the metadata to try to identify each frame type. With a couple
exceptions, however, this method is largely a wrapper for the
``check_frame_type`` method of each spectrograph; e.g., see
:func:`~pypeit.spectrographs.keck_deimos.KeckDEIMOSSpectrograph.check_frame_type`
for DEIMOS. The relevant exposure time for each frame can be refined
using parameters in the pypeit file. For example, to edit the
exposure time for ``pixelflat`` images to be between 15 and 30
seconds, you can include the following lines in your :ref:`pypeit_file`:

.. code-block:: ini

    [calibrations]
        [[pixelflatframe]]
            exprng = 15, 30

Note that you can set either (or both) of the limits to ``None`` such
that it is undefined. I.e.:

.. code-block:: python

    from pypeit.spectrographs.keck_deimos import KeckDEIMOSSpectrograph
    KeckDEIMOSSpectrograph().default_pypeit_par()['calibrations']['pixelflatframe']['exprng']

shows the default exposure-time range for pixel flats is ``[None,
30]``, meaning there is no lower limit on the exposure time for the
pixel-flats. At the moment, only the exposure time can be altered
programmatically for the frame type determination; all other
conditions are hard-coded.

.. TODO: I'm not sure this functionality, at least at the user level, is ever
   actually used now.  I doubt people ever run pypeit_setup with a preset pypeit
   file with the old data block that just had a wild-card path the globs files,
   which is what you'd need to do this.
